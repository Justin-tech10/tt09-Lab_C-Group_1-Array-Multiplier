## How it works

Explain how your project works
This projects works, where it takes a 8bit binary number that splits into 4 bit valuse to multiply them together to get a product. 

## How to test

Explain how to use your project
This project is to test the product of multiplying 4 bit numbers, to test this we have to give the projects a 8 bit values to then have 4x4 binary product. 

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
